# latlong-distance
Calculates distance between two coordinates.
This program was written by Alexander Dua to calculate the distance between two pairs of coordinates. It does so by executing the haversine formula. More information is on the repository's GitHub website

```
// Convert Degress to Radians
function Deg2Rad( deg ) { // Creates a function called Deg2Rad that will take coordinates in decimal degrees and convert them to radians. deg is the input.
  return deg * Math.PI / 180; // Takes the input deg, multiplies it by pi, then divides it by 180.
 }
```
